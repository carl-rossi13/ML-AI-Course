# Required Assignment 17.1: Comparing Classifiers

### This folder contains machine learning models derived from data representing 17 marketing campaigns conducted from May 2008 to November 2010, corresponding to a total of 79,354 contacts.
### The objective of these models is to predict the likelihood of a client subscribing to the term deposit, enabling the bank to optimize its marketing efforts and improve campaign efficiency.
### A total of 19 features were used to create 4 models; (1) a logistic regression model, (2) KNN, (3) Decision Tree, and (4) SVC.
### The models were optimized with features engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
### The Logistic Regression, decision tree, and SVC models outperformed the baseline model. The KNN model significantly under performed even after optimization.
### The over performing models yielded comparable results for predictive accuracy, however, the SVC model was significantly more computationally demanding.
### In conclusion, a logistic regression model or a decision tree is recommended.
